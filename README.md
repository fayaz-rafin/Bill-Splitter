## Bill Splitter
Bill Splitter is a simple python script which allows you to split the bill with however many people you want to. It's created using python 3 and it's really useful in situations where you have to split the bill among different people but you are unaware how much should each person share. I create this for one of my challengs for Local Hack Day: build 2022 Day 3.
